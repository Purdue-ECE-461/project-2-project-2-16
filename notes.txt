Starter code notes

Had install problems, hopefully fixed with some small edits

Regenerated github token for the .env file

Correctness score is not factored into the scoring mechanism at all
    Tried to use some sort of "ML Regression"
    Use gitrisky to try and analyze a code base (I'm guessing)
    Currently creates an exception in the program

Have an index out of range error in printing of scores
Using a dictionary to print scores? -> mapping url to list of scores 
    Editing this print, seems very complicated for no reason
    They are trying to use ordered dictionaries, which only exist in Python 3.7+
    Python version being used 3.9.1
    Confusing and inefficient

Print does not work at all

Score calculation is incorrect, net score should be [0, 1], net scores are currently [28-32]
    Bus factor score is main problem of this
    Net score calculation is also just a sum, not on a [0, 1] scale
    Net score calculations does not assign weights to scores
    UPDATE: weights were used, but because the print errors, need to be recalculated
    UPDATE: Their weights are as follows
        ramp-up: .1
        num_case: .3
        num_maintainer: .4
        log: .1
        license: .1

License score does not check for actual license compatibility

Bus factor is calculated based on the len() of the json from the request of the contributors url
    Completely incorrect will need to recalculate

Ramp up score is also very suspect
    Again pulling random values from json and calculating with no weights/standardized scale

write_log_file(): creates exception due to not handling file
    nothing catches exception
